//! DECODE layer — resolve a synthetic placeholder's `EquipParamGoods` row and turn it into the
//! pure [`er_codec::GoodsRowFields`].
//!
//! This is the single biggest "delete the binding layer" win. The C++ client hand-walked
//! `repo -> +idx*0x48+0x88 -> +0x80 -> +0x80 -> rowCount @ +0x0A -> 24-byte index entries -> row`
//! (er_hooks.h / er_gamehook.h) and then read raw byte offsets (er_goods_row.h). All of that is
//! replaced by the `eldenring` crate's typed `EQUIP_PARAM_GOODS_ST` + the `ParamDef` "safe param
//! lookup" trait. We read named fields off a typed struct; the row stride / offsets / blob walk are
//! the crate's problem (and patch-tracked upstream).
//!
//! ⚠️ COMPILE-TARGET SKETCH (not yet built). Lookup symbols RESOLVED against eldenring 0.14
//! — see the spike root's VERIFY-RESOLUTION.md. This is the Phase-1 spike payoff.

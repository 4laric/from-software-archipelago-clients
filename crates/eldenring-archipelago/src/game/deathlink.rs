//! Wave D — **DeathLink**. Rust port of the DeathLink mechanic from
//! `ArchipelagoInterface.cpp` (`set_bounced_handler` ~536-562 INCOMING, `sendDeathLink` ~620-630
//! OUTGOING, and the `DeathLink` tag pushed in `ConnectSlot` ~309) onto archipelago_rs 2.1.1.
//!
//! ## What this module owns vs. what's a hole
//! The **network protocol** side is COMPLETE and correct against archipelago_rs (verified against the
//! vendored crate under `third_party/archipelago_rs`):
//!   * INCOMING: `net.rs` matches `ap::Event::DeathLink { source, cause, .. }` and calls
//!     `on_death_link_event(..)`, which (after the self-source guard) latches a "kill pending" flag.
//!   * OUTGOING: the game tick detects a LOCAL death (`poll_outgoing_death`) and latches a
//!     "send pending" flag; `net.rs` drains it with `take_pending_outgoing()` and calls
//!     `client.death_link(DeathLinkOptions)`.
//!   * TAG: `net.rs` adds `ap::tags::DEATH_LINK` to `ConnectionOptions::tags(..)` iff `is_enabled()`.
//!
//! The **two game-memory touchpoints** are honest `// RE:` stubs — the ER kill mechanism was never
//! implemented (C++ `GameHook.cpp::manageDeathLink()` is a stub for ER), and this client has no
//! player-HP / death-state accessor yet (only `play_region_id`, see flags.rs). Both stubs carry a
//! Cheat-Engine worksheet in their doc comment. Wiring this module lets the protocol go live now;
//! Alaric fills `kill_player()` and `read_local_death()` in a CE session.
//!
//! ## Thread rule (inherited from features.rs / net.rs)
//! NAME/event decisions run on the NET thread and only LATCH an AtomicBool; every game-memory read
//! (death detection) and write (the kill) happens on the FrameBegin TICK. The net thread never
//! touches game memory; the game thread never touches the socket. Two atomics bridge the two
//! directions — no locks, no allocation on the hot path.

#![allow(dead_code)] // handlers/stubs are wired ahead of the RE fill-in
